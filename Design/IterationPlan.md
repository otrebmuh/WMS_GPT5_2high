## Iteration plan (ADD Step 2)

This iteration plan establishes the **goal of each ADD iteration** by selecting and sequencing architectural drivers. Iteration 1 creates the initial structure (“whole system” refinement). Subsequent iterations address the highest-priority drivers, with **business-critical operational flows** and their enabling quality attributes addressed early.

| Iteration | Goal (main outcome of the iteration) | Drivers to be addressed (IDs) |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | **Initial structuring of the system**: define the primary architectural decomposition and boundaries for a single `WMSInstance` and its integrations, establishing the “walking skeleton” containers and responsibility allocation. | **Concerns**: AC-02, AC-04. **Constraints**: C-01, C-02, C-03, C-04, C-05, C-06, C-07. **Quality**: QA-08, QA-06. |
| 2 | **Foundation for inventory correctness**: design the core inventory model, invariants, and transaction boundaries so that inventory-affecting actions are consistent and auditable across key domain objects (balances, statuses, reservations). | **User stories**: US-01, US-02, US-15. **Quality**: QA-04, QA-05. **Concerns**: AC-05. |
| 3 | **High-throughput replenishment order intake and planning**: design order ingestion, validation, and allocation/wave planning to sustain peak demand without downtime while preserving inventory consistency. | **User stories**: US-03, US-04. **Quality**: QA-01, QA-04. **Concerns**: AC-01, AC-02. |
| 4 | **Picking execution and automation integration**: design pick task distribution and pick confirmations, including resilient/idempotent integration patterns with picking systems and exception handling to keep operations running. | **User stories**: US-05, US-07, US-06. **Quality**: QA-04, QA-06, QA-05. **Constraints**: C-06. **Concerns**: AC-03. |
| 5 | **Outbound shipping confirmations and financial integration**: design shipment lifecycle, store confirmations, and financial events with strong consistency, traceability, and idempotency across asynchronous integrations. | **User stories**: US-09, US-10, US-08. **Quality**: QA-04, QA-06. **Constraints**: C-04, C-05. **Concerns**: AC-03, AC-05. |
| 6 | **Disconnected operations and synchronization**: design the approach for continuing warehouse operations during loss of connectivity and performing safe reconciliation/synchronization on reconnect (no loss, no duplicates, bounded divergence with external systems). | **Quality**: QA-03, QA-04. **Constraints**: C-06. **Concerns**: AC-03, AC-05. |
| 7 | **Availability, isolation, operability, and safe change**: refine deployment topology, resilience, DR, observability, and progressive delivery so instances remain isolated and support staff can operate the fleet with controlled rollouts. | **Quality**: QA-02, QA-08, QA-09, QA-10. **Constraints**: C-01, C-03. **Concerns**: AC-04, AC-07. |
| 8 | **Security, governance, and inventory control operations**: design cross-cutting security and compliance controls (RBAC, encryption, audit), plus counting/reconciliation/approvals to preserve inventory accuracy and support audits. | **User stories**: US-11, US-18, US-13, US-19. **Quality**: QA-07, QA-04. **Constraints**: C-02, C-07. **Concerns**: AC-06, AC-08. |
